# Deep Research

Execute comprehensive deep research on the given topic using the 7-phase research methodology and Graph of Thoughts framework.

## Topic

$ARGUMENTS

## Research Workflow

This command will execute the following steps:

### Step 1: Question Refinement
Use the **question-refiner** skill to ask clarifying questions and generate a structured research prompt.

### Step 2: Research Planning
Break down the research topic into 3-7 subtopics and create a detailed execution plan.

### Step 3: Team-Based Research (Academic-First)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: If 4+ subtopics → MUST use Agent Teams (TeamCreate). Do NOT fall back to Task sub-agents.**

**Team Mode (4+ subtopics) — REQUIRED**:
1. **TeamCreate**: Create research team "research-{topic_slug}"
2. **TaskCreate**: Define tasks for each subtopic with dependencies
3. **Spawn teammates** (Task with `team_name` param): academic-1..N, web-researcher, verifier, synthesizer
4. **Assign tasks** via TaskUpdate with `owner` parameter
5. **Monitor**: Receive finding reports via SendMessage, GoT score, redirect if needed
6. **Progressive synthesis**: SendMessage to synthesizer after 2+ agents complete
7. **Verification loop**: Forward claims to verifier via SendMessage, apply corrections
8. **Shutdown**: shutdown_request to all teammates → TeamDelete

**Sub-Agent Mode (ONLY for 1-3 subtopics)**:
- Launch all Task agents in one response with `run_in_background: true`
- 🚫 Do NOT use this mode when subtopics >= 4

**Agent types (both modes)**:
- **Academic Research Agents (3-4) [PRIMARY]**: Use MCP tools (`mcp__arxiv__*`, `mcp__paper-search-mcp__*`)
- **Web Research Agents (1-2) [SUPPLEMENTARY]**: Current information, trends, news
- **Verifier Agent (1) [REQUIRED]**: Cross-validate claims against academic literature
- **Synthesizer Agent (1) [PROGRESSIVE]**: Begin synthesis after 2+ agents complete

### Step 4: Source Triangulation
Compare findings across multiple sources and validate claims using the A-E quality rating system.

### Step 5: Knowledge Synthesis
Use the **synthesizer** skill to combine findings into a coherent report with inline citations.

### Step 6: Citation Validation
Use the **citation-validator** skill to verify all claims have accurate, complete citations.

### Step 7: Output Generation
Generate structured research outputs in the `RESEARCH/[topic]/` directory:
- README.md
- executive_summary.md
- full_report.md
- data/
- visuals/
- sources/
- research_notes/
- appendices/

## Citation Requirements

Ensure every factual claim includes:
1. Author/Organization name
2. Publication date
3. Source title
4. Direct URL/DOI
5. Page numbers (if applicable)
